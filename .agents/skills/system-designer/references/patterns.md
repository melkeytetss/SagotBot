## Patterns

  #### **Name**
Start Monolith, Evolve to Services
  #### **Description**
Begin with a monolith, extract services when boundaries become clear
  #### **When**
Any new project, especially with uncertain requirements
  #### **Example**
    # Phase 1: Well-structured monolith
    """
    /app
      /users          # User module
      /orders         # Order module
      /payments       # Payment module
      /notifications  # Notification module
    
    Each module has clear interface, could become service later.
    All share one database, one deployment.
    """
    
    # When to extract a service? Only when ALL true:
    # 1. Module has different scaling needs (10x more load)
    # 2. Module needs independent deployment (different release cycle)
    # 3. Team ownership is clear (dedicated team for this domain)
    # 4. Interface is stable (no churn in how other modules call it)
    
    # Phase 2: Extract first service when justified
    """
    /app
      /users
      /orders
      /payments
    
    notifications-service/  # Extracted because:
      - High volume, different scaling
      - Can be async (doesn't block orders)
      - Simple interface (fire and forget)
    """
    
    # Warning signs you extracted too early:
    # - Constantly changing the service interface
    # - Service and monolith deployed together anyway
    # - Debugging requires reading logs from multiple systems

  #### **Name**
Four Pillars Assessment
  #### **Description**
Evaluate system against scalability, availability, reliability, performance
  #### **When**
Designing or reviewing any system
  #### **Example**
    # For any system, assess these four pillars:
    
    ## SCALABILITY
    # Can the system handle growth?
    """
    Questions:
    - What's 10x current load? 100x?
    - Which component breaks first under load?
    - Can we scale horizontally (add instances)?
    - What's the cost curve for scaling?
    
    Red flags:
    - Single database write path
    - In-memory state in web servers
    - Synchronous calls to slow services
    """
    
    ## AVAILABILITY
    # Is the system operational when needed?
    """
    Questions:
    - What's the SLA/SLO? (99.9% = 8.7 hours/year downtime)
    - What are the single points of failure?
    - How long is recovery from each failure mode?
    - What fails gracefully, what fails completely?
    
    Red flags:
    - No redundancy for critical paths
    - Single region deployment
    - No health checks or circuit breakers
    """
    
    ## RELIABILITY
    # Does the system do what it's supposed to?
    """
    Questions:
    - What happens when components disagree?
    - How do we ensure data consistency?
    - What's the blast radius of a bug?
    - How do we detect silent failures?
    
    Red flags:
    - No data validation at boundaries
    - Optimistic assumptions about external services
    - Missing idempotency for operations
    """
    
    ## PERFORMANCE
    # Is the system fast enough?
    """
    Questions:
    - What's acceptable latency? P50, P99?
    - Where are the hot paths?
    - What can be cached?
    - What can be async?
    
    Red flags:
    - N+1 queries
    - Synchronous chains of network calls
    - No caching layer

## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Big Ball of Mud
  #### **Description**
System without recognizable architecture
  #### **Why**
    No clear boundaries, everything depends on everything. Change is scary
    because you don't know what will break. New developers take months to
    understand the system. Technical debt accumulates exponentially.
    
  #### **Instead**
Define clear module boundaries. Even in a monolith, enforce interfaces between components.

---
  #### **Name**
Distributed Monolith
  #### **Description**
Microservices that must be deployed together
  #### **Why**
    All the complexity of microservices, none of the benefits. Services are
    tightly coupled through shared databases, synchronous calls, or shared
    models. Can't deploy independently, can't scale independently.
    
  #### **Instead**
If services share a database or always deploy together, merge them. Real microservices have independent data stores.

---
  #### **Name**
Golden Hammer
  #### **Description**
Using familiar technology for every problem
  #### **Why**
    "We know Kafka, so let's use it for everything." But Kafka is overkill
    for 100 events/day. "We know React, so the admin panel uses React."
    But a simple CRUD admin is faster with server-rendered HTML.
    
  #### **Instead**
Match technology to problem. Use boring tech by default, special tech only when justified.

---
  #### **Name**
Resume-Driven Development
  #### **Description**
Choosing technology for career advancement
  #### **Why**
    Kubernetes for 3-person startup. GraphQL for internal tool. Microservices
    for MVP. Technology chosen because it's impressive, not appropriate.
    Team spends more time on infrastructure than product.
    
  #### **Instead**
Optimize for shipping. The most impressive thing on your resume is "system that made $X."

---
  #### **Name**
Premature Decomposition
  #### **Description**
Breaking into services before understanding domain
  #### **Why**
    You're drawing service boundaries before you understand the domain.
    Wrong boundaries are incredibly expensive to fix - you'll need to
    move data, change APIs, and coordinate multiple teams.
    
  #### **Instead**
Build a well-structured monolith. Extract services only when you have evidence for the boundaries.

---
  #### **Name**
Synchronous Chain of Doom
  #### **Description**
Long chains of synchronous service calls
  #### **Why**
    User request calls Service A, which calls B, which calls C, which calls D.
    Latency adds up. Any failure breaks the chain. Debugging spans 4 services.
    This is a distributed monolith with extra steps.
    
  #### **Instead**
Keep critical paths short. Use async for non-critical operations. Consider if you need separate services at all.
