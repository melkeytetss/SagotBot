    on:
      push:
        branches: [main]
      workflow_dispatch:
    
    # Explicit permissions - never use defaults
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write  # For OIDC
    
    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

          - name: Run tests
            run: npm test
    
      deploy:
        needs: test
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        environment: production  # Requires approval
        steps:

    on:
      workflow_call:
        inputs:

              # Deployment logic here
    
    # Calling workflow (in app repo)
    # jobs:
    #   deploy:
    #     uses: org/shared-workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml@v1
    #     with:
    #       environment: production

## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Secrets in Logs
  #### **Description**
Accidentally logging secrets or sensitive data
  #### **Why**
CI logs are often accessible to many people. One echo $SECRET or debug mode and credentials are exposed. Log aggregators persist secrets forever.
  #### **Instead**
Never echo secrets. Use ::add-mask::. Review all log output. Use OIDC instead of long-lived tokens.

---
  #### **Name**
Unpinned Actions
  #### **Description**
Using @main or @latest for third-party actions
  #### **Why**
Supply chain attack vector. Action changes between runs. tj-actions/changed-files attack compromised thousands of repos. Malicious code runs with your secrets.
  #### **Instead**
Pin to specific versions (@v4) or SHA digests. Use Dependabot to update safely. Audit third-party actions.

---
  #### **Name**
Overly Broad Permissions
  #### **Description**
Using default GITHUB_TOKEN permissions or assuming admin
  #### **Why**
Token with write-all can modify repo, push code, access secrets. Compromised workflow becomes full repo takeover. Blast radius is entire organization.
  #### **Instead**
Explicit permissions block. Read-only by default. Least privilege for each job.

---
  #### **Name**
No Rollback Strategy
  #### **Description**
Deploy forward only, no way to quickly revert
  #### **Why**
Bad deploy goes live. Only option is "fix forward" which takes hours. Users suffer. Revenue lost. On-call engineer stressed.
  #### **Instead**
Every deployment must be reversible. Blue-green for instant rollback. Version pinning. Database migrations that support rollback.

---
  #### **Name**
Testing Only in CI
  #### **Description**
Tests only run in CI, not locally by developers
  #### **Why**
Developers push and pray. CI becomes the first feedback. Long cycle times. "It works on my machine" when tests fail in CI.
  #### **Instead**
Tests must run identically locally and in CI. Same Docker images. Same environment variables. Make local testing fast.

---
  #### **Name**
Pipeline Bypasses
  #### **Description**
Allowing deployments outside the CI/CD pipeline
  #### **Why**
Emergency fix deployed via kubectl. No tests ran. No audit trail. "Just this once" becomes habit. Pipeline is optional, not mandatory.
  #### **Instead**
Pipeline is the only way to production. Emergency procedures still go through pipeline (fast-track, not bypass).
